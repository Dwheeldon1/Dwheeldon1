I am currently working towards a Cybersecurity degree at Columbia College. The program has quite a lot of programming classes involved in which I have no experience,
but I am looking forward to learning programming. After my Java class and the speed in which it went though, I decided that I would need to slow down the pace and 
go over materials again. This is a placed to put code for review by others to further my learning allowing them to review my work and offer advice.
